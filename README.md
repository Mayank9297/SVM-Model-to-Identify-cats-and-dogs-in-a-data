# **SVM Model to Identify cats and dogs in a data**

**Description:**

This repository implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify images of cats and dogs. It provides a framework for training, evaluating, and using the model for image classification tasks.

**Key Features:**

Image Classification: Leverages SVMs, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to distinguish between cat and dog images.
Customizable Preprocessing: Explore different image preprocessing techniques (resizing, normalization, etc.) to optimize model performance.
Evaluation Metrics: Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's effectiveness.
Easy to Use: Includes clear instructions and well-structured code for user-friendliness.

**Further Exploration:**

Experiment with different SVM hyperparameters (e.g., kernel type, regularization) to potentially improve accuracy.
Explore advanced image augmentation techniques to increase training data variety and potentially reduce overfitting.
Consider integrating the model into a web application or mobile app for real-time image classification.
